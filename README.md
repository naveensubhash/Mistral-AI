# Mistral AI Model Integration Project

## Overview

This project is designed to provide hands-on experience with Mistral AI's open-source and commercial models, including the Mixtral 8x7B and Mixtral 8x22B. Throughout the course, you'll explore various tasks such as effective prompting, function calling, JSON mode usage, and building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. By the end, you'll be equipped with the knowledge to select appropriate AI models for different levels of complexity and integrate them into practical applications.

## Features

1. **API Access to Mistral Models**  
   - Learn to access Mistral's models via API calls.
   - Select the right model based on task complexity:
     - **Simple tasks**: Classification, text summarization.
     - **Medium tasks**: Email writing, content generation.
     - **Advanced tasks**: Code generation, complex reasoning.
   - Understand the trade-offs between model speed and task complexity.

2. **Effective Prompting Techniques**  
   - Develop prompts to maximize model performance.
   - Customize prompts for classification, text generation, and more.

3. **Function Calling in Mistral AI**  
   - Use Mistral's function calling to offload tasks better suited for traditional code, such as querying a database.
   - Implement tools for numerical data retrieval or other external services within the LLM environment.

4. **Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System**  
   - Build a basic RAG system from scratch.
   - Learn to chunk data properly and create embeddings for efficient similarity search.
   - Integrate RAG as a function in your Mistral-powered chat system to retrieve information from documents and databases.

5. **Document Interaction via Chat Interface**  
   - Build an interactive chat interface.
   - Upload documents and ask questions, with the system retrieving relevant data using the RAG system.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Mistral AI account and API key
- Basic knowledge of Python, APIs, and LLMs

## Usage

### 1. API Access to Mistral Models
Use the `api/` module to access the Mistral models. Specify the task complexity and performance requirements to select the right model for your use case.

### 2. Function Calling
Incorporate native function calling to offload tasks that traditional code can handle more effectively, such as database querying.

### 3. Building a RAG System
Follow the `rag_system/` module to implement similarity search, data chunking, and embedding creation. Use this tool in your chat system for document interaction.

### 4. Chat Interface
The `chat_interface/` module enables you to upload documents and interact with them by asking questions. The system will retrieve relevant information using RAG.
